Classify the pages which has content Lab Results using Tensorflow:

Extract and combine the data process done on Data Extraction folder.

synthetic data is created and merged with original data and removed duplicates

Nearly 4000 balanced data is gathered and process the data with one hot encoding and padding.

split the dataset 80% for training and 20% for testing the model.

Build the model with tensorflow, using early stopping to avoid overfitting.

fit the model with training with training data and check accuracy with test data.

Evaluate the model with test data and using confusion matrix to know more about model performance like Type1 error and Type2 error.

saved the model as pickle file for further use.
